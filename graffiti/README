Graffiti is an interactive (raster) whiteboard for LAN.
It was originally created by Abhishek Kumar and Rohit Yadav in 2009 at IIT-BHU.

My best homebrew project ever: Graffiti is a Live XML protocol based Whiteboard
written in C++/Qt for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It's currently optimised for
LAN featuring automatic peer detection and group chatting.
