ScuttleButt
-----------

   ScuttleButt is the new age revamped Instant Messenger targeted at gamers,
   students, professionals and all those user groups requiring a P2P platform
   for information exchange (optimized for the local area network). It was
   created for user groups which have functional local network and unreliable
   internet administration. Take the examples of college hostels where internet
   may be banned from time to time, or companies where internet is restricted;
   in both the situations ScuttleButt provides a reliable, continuous and
   low-cost solution for communication.


How to use application

   - HTML help documentation are embedded inside the AIR installer file. To

     open them, open ScuttleButt and press the "i" button at the bottom.

   - Before starting the application, the user is required to be connected to a

   - The application is simple and intuitive, users can hang around to know
  
   functionalities.

   - Hit the refresh button to refresh the user list.

   - ScuttleButt broadcasts to the broadcasting router’s address (If your IP is

     10.9.20.19 and subnet is 255.255.255.0, then broadcasting address will be
  
   10.9.20.255), in case you directly connect two computer ScuttleButt will try
  
   to discover peer, and/or you may specify their IPs in the Add/Remove IP
  
   window to make it easy for ScuttleButt to discover peer(s).

   - Once users are detected, the user list is populated with their user names,

     IPs, groups, status and avatars.

   - To chat double click on the user in the list, a chat window will appear.

Details of Using Services

-------------------------


   - For using ScuttleButt, you are required to be connected to a ethernet/wifi
  
   network, preferably a local area network (LAN).

   - Peer discovery works only for local area network, to add users not in LAN,
  
   you may add their IPs to ScuttleButt by clicking on the "+" button at the
  
   bottom of the main application window.

   - If application was started without the network cable plugged, user has to
  
   hit refresh twice. (First hit initializes SID, second hit starts peer
  
   discovery)

   - If you directly connect two or more computers by ethernet cable, add IP
  
   address of other computer(s) as peer discovery may not discover user(s) in
  
   lack of a broadcasting router.
